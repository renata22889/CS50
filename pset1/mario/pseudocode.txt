Normal pyramide:
Set up the hight as a number
Ask user for height
Do asking user for height, while the number he's giving, is smaller than 0 or greater than 8.
Create i number of rows
    Create j number of colums, which j <= i
        Write in each a sign #
    Make new line

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // n - height of pyramid
    int n;

    do
    {
        //prompt user for height
        n = get_int("Height: ");
    }

    // allow only height numbers between <1;8>
    while (n < 1 || n > 8);

    printf("Stored: %i\n", n);

  // i - number of rows
  // create number of rows
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // j - number of columns
        // create number of columns equal to number of rows
        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++)
        {
        printf("#");

        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}


Turn out pyramide:

Set up the hight as a number
Ask user for height
Do asking user for height, while the number he's giving, is smaller than 0 or greater than 8.

Create i number of rows
    Create j number of colums, which j <= i
        Create k number of colums, which k <= j
            Write in each a sing "."
        Write in each a sign #
